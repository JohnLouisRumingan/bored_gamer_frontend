            Hi, I'm John-Louis Rumingan. I made this app while discussing with my friends one day how wonderful
            it would be if we could store the games in our collection somewhere and make events with our collection.
            </p>
            <p>
                This app allows you to create a collection, favorite games, and join game nights. 
                It allows you to see what games are being played on game nights.
                TODO:
                It will soon allow you to invite others to join game nights. 
                It will soon allow you to vote for games in those game nights.
            </p>
        </div>
